# Capstone-Ember-Front-End

Welcome to the front end of my capstone project, something that I like to call
Diem. You may notice that our symbol is a carp. I won't explain that here.

This project is designed to give our users, game masters and Dungeon masters,
better game control. Current version, V 0.9 is designed for allowing the said
user to create a text log about current progress in the game.

Not very exciting, huh?

Well if you want to know more about future releases, look on the following:
